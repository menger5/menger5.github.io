I’m Mike Enger, a PhD student in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Vanderbilt University and a Research Informaticist at RTI International. My work sits at the intersection of clinical research, data science, and health policy. Over the past 5 years, I’ve worked within large, multi-site research consortia funded by the NIH and CDC, led data coordinating efforts, and explored ways to make routinely collected health information more accessible for research purposes.

Outside of work and school, I’m an exceptionally average runner (find me on Strava via the footer), a devoted nature enthusiast, and a regular on most of the sand volleyball courts around Nashville.
